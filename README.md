# The SOLID Principles in 60 Minutes

This is the sample code used in [this talk](http://chrisjpowers.com/blog/solid-in-60). Each principle has three or four files that demonstrate refactoring steps to improve the code.

The [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nu-Uy-bRxDa4y4xQeWNXNAlF3JgZz-wubl1KzTDfmDc/edit?usp=sharing) is publicly available as well.

If your company or user group would benefit from this talk (or [many others](http://chrisjpowers.com)) then please reach out to discuss!
